# Sarcasm-Detection-In-Text

Sarcasm is a form of humor found in many languages that tries to generate humorous content by using words or sentences that may look contradicting to simple English but contains a second meaning for that sentence or a humor effect. It is a speech act where speaker conveys the meaning implicitly. This makes the sarcasm detection task interesting and challenging at the same time. Thus in this project we are detecting whether the sentence contains sarcasm or not. The project uses concepts of natural language processing to achieve the task of classification. This project is based on machine learning pipeline wherein steps like data pre-processing, data transformation, model building and model tunning is done.
